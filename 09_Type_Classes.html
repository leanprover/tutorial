We have seen that Lean's elaborator provides helpful automation,
filling in information that is tedious to enter by hand. In this
section we will explore a simple but powerful technical device known
as <i>type class inference</i>, which provides yet another mechanism for
the elaborator to supply missing information.
</p>

<p>
The notion of a <i>type class</i> originated with the <i>Haskell</i> programming
language. Many of the original uses carry over, but, as we will see,
the realm of interactive theorem proving raises even more
possibilities for their use.
</p>

<h3 id="orgb4bff32"><span class="section-number-3"> 9.1</span> Type Classes and Instances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The basic idea is simple. In Section <a href="#" onclick="myModule.loadTutorial('08_Building_Theories_and_Proofs.html', 'More_on_Coercions')">More on Coercions</a>, we saw that
any family types can serve as the source or target of a coercion. In
much the same way, any family of types can be marked as a <i>type
class</i>. Then we can declare particular elements of a type class to be
<i>instances</i>. These provide hints to the elaborator: any time the
elaborator is looking for an element of a type class, it can consult a
table of declared instances to find a suitable element.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, there are three steps involved:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, we declare a family of inductive types to be a type class.</li>
<li>Second, we declare instances of the type class.</li>
<li>Finally, we mark some implicit arguments with square brackets
instead of curly brackets, to inform the elaborator that these
arguments should be inferred by the type class mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is a somewhat frivolous example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-1' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">import data.nat
open nat

attribute nat [class]

definition nat_one [instance] : ℕ := 1

definition foo [x : ℕ] : nat := x

check @foo
eval foo

example : foo = 1 := rfl
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-1' style='display:none'>import data.nat
open nat

attribute nat [class]

definition nat_one [instance] : ℕ := 1

definition foo [x : ℕ] : nat := x

check @foo
eval foo

example : foo = 1 := rfl
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-1').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Here we declare <code>nat</code> to be a class with a "canonical" instance
<code>1</code>. Then we declare <code>foo</code> to be, essentially, the identity function
on the natural numbers, but we mark the argument implicit, and
indicate that it should be inferred by type class inference. When we write
<code>foo</code>, the preprocessor interprets it as <code>foo ?x</code>, where <code>?x</code> is an
implicit argument. But when the elaborator gets hold of the
expression, it sees that <code>?x : ℕ</code> is supposed to be solved by type
class inference. It looks for a suitable element of the class, and it
finds the instance <code>one</code>. Thus, when we evaluate <code>foo</code>, we
simply get <code>1</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to think of <code>foo</code> as defined to be equal to <code>1</code>, but
that is misleading. Every time we write <code>foo</code>, the elaborator searches
for a value. If we declare other instances of the class, that can
change the value that is assigned to the implicit argument. This can
result in seemingly paradoxical behavior. For example, we might
continue the development above as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-2' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">definition nat_two [instance] : ℕ := 2

eval foo

example : foo ≠ 1 := dec_trivial</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-2' style='display:none'>import data.nat
open nat

attribute nat [class]

definition nat_one [instance] : ℕ := 1

definition foo [x : ℕ] : nat := x

eval foo

example : foo = 1 := rfl

definition nat_two [instance] : ℕ := 2

eval foo

example : foo ≠ 1 := dec_trivial
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-2').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Now the "same" expression <code>foo</code> evaluates to <code>2</code>. Whereas before we
could prove <code>foo = 1</code>, now we can prove <code>foo ≠ 1</code>, because the
inferred implicit argument has changed. When searching for a suitable
instance of a type class, the elaborator tries the most recent
instance declaration first, by default. We will see below, however,
that it is possible to give individual instances higher or lower
priority. The proof <code>dec_trivial</code> will be explained below.
</p>

<p>
As with <code>coercion</code> and other attributes, you can assign the <code>class</code> or
<code>instance</code> attributes in a definition, or after the fact, with an
<code>attribute</code> command. As usual, the assignments <code>attribute foo [class]</code>
and <code>attribute foo [instance]</code> are only in effect in the current
namespace, but the assignments persist on import. To limit the scope
of an assignment to the current file, use the <code>local attribute</code>
variant.
</p>

<p>
The reason the example is frivolous is that there is rarely a need to
"infer" a natural number; we can just hard-code the choice of <code>1</code> or
<code>2</code> into the definition of <code>foo</code>. Type classes become useful when
they depend on parameters, in which case, the value that is inferred
depends on these parameters.
</p>

<p>
Let us work through a simple example. Many theorems hold under the
additional assumption that a type is inhabited, which is to say, it
has at least one element. For example, if <code>A</code> is a type, <code>∃ x : A, x =
x</code> is true only if <code>A</code> is inhabited. Similarly, it often happens that
we would like a definition to return a default element in a "corner
case." For example, we would like the expression <code>head l</code> to be of
type <code>A</code> when <code>l</code> is of type <code>list A</code>; but then we are faced with the
problem that <code>head l</code> needs to return an "arbitrary" element of <code>A</code> in
the case where <code>l</code> is the empty list, <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
For purposes like this, the standard library defines a type class
<code>inhabited : Type → Type</code>, to enable type class inference to infer a
"default" or "arbitrary" element of an inhabited type. We will carry
out a similar development in the examples that follow, using a
namespace <code>hide</code> to avoid conflicting with the definitions in the
standard library.
</p>

<p>
Let us start with the first step of the program above, declaring an
appropriate class:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-3' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
mk : A → inhabited A</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-3' style='display:none'>namespace hide

inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
mk : A → inhabited A

end hide
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-3').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
An element of the class <code>inhabited A</code> is simply an expression of the
form <code>inhabited.mk a</code>, for some element <code>a : A</code>. The eliminator for
the inductive type will allow us to "extract" such an element of <code>A</code>
from an element of <code>inhabited A</code>.
</p>

<p>
The second step of the program is to populate the class with some
instances:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-4' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">definition Prop.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited Prop :=
inhabited.mk true

definition bool.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited bool :=
inhabited.mk bool.tt

definition nat.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited nat :=
inhabited.mk nat.zero

definition unit.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited unit :=
inhabited.mk unit.star</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-4' style='display:none'>namespace hide

inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
mk : A → inhabited A

definition Prop.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited Prop :=
inhabited.mk true

definition bool.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited bool :=
inhabited.mk bool.tt

definition nat.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited nat :=
inhabited.mk nat.zero

definition unit.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited unit :=
inhabited.mk unit.star
end hide
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-4').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
This arranges things so that when type class inference is asked to
infer an element <code>?M : Prop</code>, it can find the element <code>true</code> to assign
to <code>?M</code>, and similarly for the elements <code>tt</code>, <code>zero</code>, and <code>star</code> of
the types <code>bool</code>, <code>nat</code>, and <code>unit</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The final step of the program is to define a function that infers an
element <code>H : inhabited A</code> and puts it to good use. The following
function simply extracts the corresponding element <code>a : A</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-5' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">definition default (A : Type) [H : inhabited A] : A :=
inhabited.rec (λ a, a) H</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-5' style='display:none'>namespace hide

inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
mk : A → inhabited A

definition Prop.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited Prop :=
inhabited.mk true

definition bool.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited bool :=
inhabited.mk bool.tt

definition nat.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited nat :=
inhabited.mk nat.zero

definition unit.is_inhabited [instance] : inhabited unit :=
inhabited.mk unit.star

definition default (A : Type) [H : inhabited A] : A :=
inhabited.rec (λ a, a) H
end hide
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-5').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
This has the effect that given a type expression <code>A</code>, whenever we
write <code>default A</code>, we are really writing <code>default A ?H</code>, leaving the
elaborator to find a suitable value for the metavariable
<code>?H</code>. When the elaborator succeeds in finding such a value, it has
effectively produced an element of type <code>A</code>, as though by magic.

</div>
<p>
In general, whenever we write <code>default A</code>, we are asking the
elaborator to synthesize an element of type <code>A</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that we can "see" the value that is synthesized with <code>eval</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

We can also codify these choices as theorems:

</div>

<p>
Sometimes we want to think of the default element of a type as being
an <i>arbitrary</i> element, whose specific value should not play a role in
our proofs. For that purpose, we can write <code>arbitrary A</code> instead of
<code>default A</code>. The definition of <code>arbitrary</code> is the same as that of
default, but is marked <code>irreducible</code> to discourage the elaborator from
unfolding it. This does not preclude proofs from making use of the
value, however, so the use of <code>arbitrary</code> rather than <code>default</code>
functions primarily to signal intent.
</p>

<h3 id="orgcf69130"><span class="section-number-3"> 9.2</span> Chaining Instances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
If that were the extent of type class inference, it would not be all
the impressive; it would be simply a mechanism of storing a list of
instances for the elaborator to find in a lookup table. What makes
type class inference powerful is that one can <i>chain</i> instances. That
is, an instance declaration can in turn depend on an implicit instance
of a type class. This causes class inference to chain through
instances recursively, backtracking when necessary, in a Prolog-like
search.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following definition shows that if two types <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code> are inhabited, then so is their product:

instance can infer, for example, a default element of <code>nat × bool × unit</code>:

</div>
<p>
Given the expression <code>default (nat × bool × unit)</code>, the elaborator is
called on to infer an implicit argument <code>?M : inhabited (nat × bool ×
unit)</code>. The instance <code>inhabited_product</code> reduces this to inferring
<code>?M1 : inhabited nat</code> and <code>?M2 : inhabited (bool × unit)</code>. The first
one is solved by the instance <code>nat.is_inhabited</code>. The second invokes
another application of <code>inhabited_product</code>, and so on, until the
system has inferred the value <code>(nat.zero, bool.tt, unit.star)</code>.

Similarly, we can inhabit function spaces with suitable constant
functions:

<p>
In this case, type class inference finds the default element <code>λ (a :

<p>
As an exercise, try defining default instances for other types, such
as sum types and the list type.

<div id="outline-container-org63f967a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org63f967a"><span class="section-number-3"> 9.3</span> Decidable Propositions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Let us consider another example of a type class defined in the
standard library, namely the type class of <code>decidable</code>
propositions. Roughly speaking, an element of <code>Prop</code> is said to be
decidable if we can decide whether it is true or false. The
distinction is only useful in constructive mathematics; classically,
every proposition is decidable. Nonetheless, as we will see, the
implementation of the type class allows for a smooth transition
between constructive and classical logic.
</p>

<p>
In the standard library, <code>decidable</code> is defined formally as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-12' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">inductive decidable [class] (p : Prop) : Type :=

</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-12').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Logically speaking, having an element <code>t : decidable p</code> is stronger
than having an element <code>t : p ∨ ¬p</code>; it enables us to define values of
an arbitrary type depending on the truth value of <code>p</code>. For example,
for the expression <code>if p then a else b</code> to make sense, we need to know
that <code>p</code> is decidable. That expression is syntactic sugar for <code>ite p a
b</code>, where <code>ite</code> is defined as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-13' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">definition ite (c : Prop) [H : decidable c] {A : Type} (t e : A) : A :=

<p>
The standard library also contains a variant of <code>ite</code> called <code>dite</code>,
the dependent if-then-else expression. It is defined as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-14' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">definition dite (c : Prop) [H : decidable c] {A : Type} (t : c → A) (e : ¬ c → A) : A :=

</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-14').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
That is, in <code>dite c t e</code>, we can assume <code>Hc : c</code> in the "then" branch,
and <code>Hnc : ¬ c</code> in the "else" branch.  To make <code>dite</code> more convenient
to use, Lean allows us to write <code>if h : c then t else e</code> instead of
<code>dite c (λ h : c, t) (λ h : ¬ c, e)</code>.

<p>
In the standard library, we cannot prove that every proposition is
decidable. But we can prove that <i>certain</i> propositions are
decidable. For example, we can prove that basic operations like
equality and comparisons on the natural numbers and the integers are
decidable. Moreover, decidability is preserved under propositional
connectives:

Thus we can carry out definitions by cases on decidable predicates on
the natural numbers:

<p>
Turning on implicit arguments shows that the elaborator has inferred
the decidability of the proposition <code>x &lt; a ∨ x &gt; b</code>, simply by
applying appropriate instances.
</p>

<p>
With the classical axioms, we can prove that every proposition is
decidable. When you import the classical axioms, then, <code>decidable p</code>
has an instance for every <code>p</code>, and the elaborator infers that value
quickly. Thus all theorems in the standard library that rely on
decidability assumptions are freely available in the classical
library.
</p>

<p>
This explains the "proof" <code>dec_trivial</code> in Section <a href="#" onclick="myModule.scrollTutorialTo('orgb4bff32')">Type Classes and
Instances</a> above. The expression <code>dec_trivial</code> is actually defined in
the module <code>init.logic</code> to be notation for the expression <code>of_is_true
trivial</code>, where <code>of_is_true</code> infers the decidability of the theorem
you are trying to prove, extracts the corresponding decision
procedure, and confirms that it evaluates to <code>true</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
We now consider the application of type classes that motivates their
use in functional programming languages like Haskell, namely, to
overload notation in a principled way. In Lean, a symbol like <code>+</code> can
be given entirely unrelated meanings, a phenomenon that is sometimes
called "ad-hoc" overloading. Typically, however, we use the <code>+</code> symbol to
denote a binary function from a type to itself, that is, a function of
type <code>A → A → A</code> for some type <code>A</code>. We can use type classes to infer
an appropriate addition function for suitable types <code>A</code>. We will see
in the next section that this is especially useful for developing
algebraic hierarchies of structures in a formal setting.
</p>

<p>
We can declare a type class <code>has_add A</code> as follows:

The class <code>has_add A</code> is supposed to be inhabited exactly when there
is an appropriate addition function for <code>A</code>. The <code>add</code> function is
designed to find an instance of <code>has_add A</code> for the given type, <code>A</code>,
and apply the corresponding binary addition function. The notation
<code>a + b</code> thus refers to the addition that is appropriate to the type of
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. We can the declare instances for <code>nat</code>, <code>int</code>, and
<code>bool</code>:

<p>
In the example above, we expose the coercions in namespaces <code>nat</code>
and <code>int</code>, so that we can use numerals. If we opened these namespace
outright, the symbol <code>+</code> would be ad-hoc overloaded. This would result
in an ambiguity as to which addition we have in mind when we write
<code>a + b</code> for <code>a b : nat</code>. The ambiguity is benign, however, since the
new interpretation of <code>+</code> for <code>nat</code> is definitionally equal to the
usual one. Setting the option to turn off notation while
pretty-printing shows us that it is the new <code>add</code> function that is
inferred in each case. Thus we are relying on type class overloading
to disambiguate the meaning of the expression, rather than ad-hoc
overloading.
</p>

<p>
As with <code>inhabited</code> and <code>decidable</code>, the power of type class inference
stems not only from the fact that the class enables the elaborator to
look up appropriate instances, but also from the fact that it can
chain instances to infer complex addition operations. For example,
assuming that there are appropriate addition functions for types <code>A</code>
and <code>B</code>, we can define addition on <code>A × B</code> pointwise:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Recall from Section <a href="#" onclick="myModule.loadTutorial('05_Interacting_with_Lean.html', 'Displaying_Information')">Displaying Information</a> that you can ask Lean for
information about the classes and instances that are currently in
scope:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-21' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">print classes

print instances inhabited
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-21').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
At times, you may find that the type class inference fails to find an
expected instance, or, worse, falls into an infinite loop and times
out. To help debug in these situations, Lean enables you to request a
trace of the search:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-22' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">set_option trace.class_instances true
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-22' style='display:none'>set_option trace.class_instances true
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-22').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
If you add this to your file in Emacs mode and use <code>C-c C-x</code> to run an
independent Lean process on your file, the output buffer will show a
trace every time the type class resolution procedure is subsequently
triggered.
</p>

<p>
You can also limit the search depth (the default is 32):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-23' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">set_option class.instance_max_depth 5
</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-23' style='display:none'>set_option class.instance_max_depth 5
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-23').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Remember also that in the Emacs Lean mode, tab completion works in
<code>set_option</code>, to help you find suitable options.
</p>

<p>
As noted above, the type class instances in a given context represent
a Prolog-like program, which gives rise to a backtracking search. Both
the efficiency of the program and the solutions that are found can
depend on the order in which the system tries the instance.  Instances
which are declared last are tried first.  Moreover, if instances are
declared in other modules, the order in which they are tried depends
on the order in which namespaces are opened.  Instances declared in
namespaces which are opened later are tried earlier.
</p>

<p>
You can change the order that type classes instances are tried by
assigning them a <i>priority</i>. When an instance is declared, it is
assigned a priority value <code>std.priority.default</code>, defined to be 1000
in module <code>init.priority</code> in both the standard and hott libraries. You
can assign other priorities when defining an instance, and you can
later change the priority with the <code>attribute</code> command. The following
example illustrates how this is done:

We can also use the bounded quantifier to define a computable
function. In this example, the expression <code>is_constant_range f n</code>
returns <code>tt</code> if and only if the function <code>f</code> has the same value for
every <code>i</code> such that <code>0 ≤ i &lt; n</code>.
