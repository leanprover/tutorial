<h3 id="orga397b7b"><span class="section-number-3"> 1.1</span> Computers and Theorem Proving</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
<i>Formal verification</i> involves the use of logical and computational
methods to establish claims that are expressed in precise mathematical
terms. These can include ordinary mathematical theorems, as well as
claims that pieces of hardware or software, network protocols, and
mechanical and hybrid systems meet their specifications. In practice,
there is not a sharp distinction between verifying a piece of
mathematics and verifying the correctness of a system: formal
verification requires describing hardware and software systems in
mathematical terms, at which point establishing claims as to their
correctness becomes a form of theorem proving. Conversely, the proof
of a mathematical theorem may require a lengthy computation, in which
case verifying the truth of the theorem requires verifying that the
computation does what it is supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
The gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a
proof, and twentieth-century developments in logic show most if not
all conventional proof methods can be reduced to a small set of axioms
and rules in any of a number of foundational systems. With this
reduction, there are two ways that a computer can help establish a
claim: it can help find a proof in the first place, and it can help
verify that a purported proof is correct.
</p>

<p>
<i>Automated theorem proving</i> focuses on the "finding"
aspect. Resolution theorem provers, tableau theorem provers, fast
satisfiability solvers, and so on provide means of establishing the
validity of formulas in propositional and first-order logic. Other
systems provide search procedures and decision procedures for specific
languages and domains, such as linear or nonlinear expressions over
the integers or the real numbers. Architectures like SMT
("satisfiability modulo theories") combine domain-general search
methods with domain-specific procedures. Computer algebra systems and
specialized mathematical software packages provide means of
carrying out mathematical computations, establishing mathematical
bounds, or finding mathematical objects. A calculation can be viewed
as a proof as well, and these systems, too, help establish
mathematical claims.
</p>

<p>
Automated reasoning systems strive for power and efficiency, often at
the expense of guaranteed soundness. Such systems can have bugs, and
it can be difficult to ensure that the results they deliver are
correct. In contrast, <i>interactive theorem proving</i> focuses on the
"verification" aspect of theorem proving, requiring that every claim
is supported by a proof in a suitable axiomatic foundation. This sets
a very high standard: every rule of inference and every step of a
calculation has to be justified by appealing to prior definitions and
theorems, all the way down to basic axioms and rules. In fact, most
such systems provide fully elaborated "proof objects" that can be
communicated to other systems and checked independently. Constructing
such proofs typically requires much more input and interaction from
users, but it allows us to obtain deeper and more complex proofs.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Lean Theorem Prover</i> aims to bridge the gap between interactive
and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and
methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the
construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. The goal is to
support both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex
systems, and to verify claims in both domains.

<h3 id="org2c43435"><span class="section-number-3"> 1.2</span> About Lean</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The <i>Lean</i> project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft
Research Redmond in 2012. It is an ongoing, long-term effort, and
much of the potential for automation will be realized only gradually
over time. Lean is released under the Apache 2.0 license, a permissive
open source license that permits others to use and extend the code and
mathematical libraries freely.
</p>

<p>
There are currently two ways to use Lean. The first is to run it from
the web: a Javascript version of Lean, a standard library of
definitions and theorems, and an editor are actually downloaded to
your browser and run there. This provides a quick and convenient way to
begin experimenting with the system.
</p>

<p>
The second way to use Lean is to install and run it natively on your
computer. The native version is much faster than the web version, and
is more flexible in other ways, too. It comes with an Emacs mode that
offers powerful support for writing and debugging proofs, and is much
better suited for serious use.

<div id="outline-container-org12af75f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org12af75f"><span class="section-number-3"> 1.3</span> About this Book</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
This book is designed to teach you to develop and verify proofs in
Lean. Much of the background information you will need in order to do
this is not specific to Lean at all. To start with, we will explain
the logical system that Lean is based on, a version of <i>dependent type
theory</i> that is powerful enough to prove almost any conventional
mathematical theorem, and expressive enough to do it in a natural
way. We will explain not only how to define mathematical objects and
express mathematical assertions in dependent type theory, but also how
to use it as a language for writing proofs. 
</p>

<p>
In fact, Lean supports two versions of dependent type theory. The
first is a variant of a system known as the <i>Calculus of Inductive
Constructions</i>[<a href="#Coquand1988">1</a>,<a href="#pfenning:paulin:mohring:89">2</a>], or
<i>CIC</i>. This is the system used by Lean's standard library, and is the
focus of this tutorial. The second version of dependent type theory
implements an axiomatic framework for <a target='_blank' href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/">homotopy type theory</a>,
which we will discuss in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>
Because fully detailed axiomatic proofs are so complicated, the
challenge of theorem proving is to have the computer fill in as many
of the details as possible. We will describe various methods to
support this in dependent type theory. For example, we will discuss
term rewriting, and Lean's automated methods for simplifying terms and
expressions automatically. Similarly, we will discuss methods of
<i>elaboration</i> and <i>type inference</i>, which can be used to support
flexible forms of algebraic reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Finally, of course, we will discuss features that are specific to
Lean, including the language with which you can communicate with the
system, and the mechanisms Lean offers for managing complex theories
and data.
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this book within Lean's online tutorial system, you
will see a copy of the Lean editor at right, with an output buffer
beneath it. At any point, you can type things into the editor, press
the "play" button, and see Lean's response. Notice that you can resize
the various windows if you would like.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the text you will find examples of Lean code like the one
below:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<juicy-ace-editor id='lean-juicy-ace-editor-1' mode="ace/mode/lean" readonly="true">theorem and_commutative (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
assume Hpq : p ∧ q,
have Hp : p, from and.elim_left Hpq,
have Hq : q, from and.elim_right Hpq,
show q ∧ p, from and.intro Hq Hp</juicy-ace-editor><div id='lean-full-code-1' style='display:none'>theorem and_commutative (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
assume Hpq : p ∧ q,
have Hp : p, from and.elim_left Hpq,
have Hq : q, from and.elim_right Hpq,
show q ∧ p, from and.intro Hq Hp
</div><div class='no-print' align="left"><button type="button" onclick="invoke_leanjs($('#lean-full-code-1').text());">Try it yourself &raquo;</button></div>
</div>
<p>
Once again, if you are reading the book online, you will see a button
that reads "try it yourself." Pressing the button copies the example
into the Lean editor with enough surrounding context to make the
example compile correctly, and then runs Lean. We recommend running
the examples and experimenting with the code on your own as you work
through the chapters that follow.
